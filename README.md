# Matt's personal code compendium

### Me and my code
I've been an IT pro for higher education since 2007 and a gamer since 1990. This is an index of some projects I've done which I felt are worth sharing.  

This page is dedicated for listing the personal projects I've done, mostly relating to various tools and modding for games I play. For a much larger compendium of projects related to my career, see [code-compendium](https://github.com/mmseng/code-compendium).
